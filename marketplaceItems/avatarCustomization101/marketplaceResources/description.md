Have you ever wondered what’s possible in High Fidelity to update your avatar?

What about change your pant’s material to fit the season?
Was there a time you wanted to express emotions on your avatar but didn't know how? 
Have you ever noticed those awesome avatars with hair and clothing that move in world when they move and thought to yourself, “Hey! I want some flow on my hair and clothing too!”?

You're in good company. So did I!

Avatar 101 is a learning tool to showcase customizations you and other creators can make to their avatars using High Fidelity.

*Customizations include:*
1. Avatar submesh material customization using material entities
2. Facial blendshape manipulation to express emotion on your avatar’s face
3. Adding avatar joints that move when your avatar moves in world using flow.js in Hifi

The app utilizes “Avi,” a customized Woody avatar, with a jacket submesh, specifically named blendshapes on its face, and flow joints on its leaf hair. We use Avi because he is specifically configured to interact with the app.

**We highly recommend checking out the Github README and source code to learn more about the customizations!**

Happy learning and happy customizing!

Brought to you by the Experiences team as a blueprint project with the source code and a detailed README about how it was made. Feel free to modify the code to your needs!

**Please note! To use this app, please unload any running flow.js scripts. Any additional running flow.js scripts will conflict.**
