This Vending Machine is a **Blueprint Item** created by the Experiences Team at High Fidelity.

The Vending Machine is an entity you can stage wherever you have edit rights that vends marketplace items. After a user clicks on a Vending Machine's button, they will see the marketplace checkout page for that item.

If you check out the code for this item, you'll see that we've made it really easy to repackage it with the marketplace items of your choice! We can't wait to see what you come up with. The Vending Machine code can be found [here](https://github.com/highfidelity/hifi-content/tree/master/marketplaceItems/vendingMachine).

NOTE: Any user with lock/unlock rights in the domain in which you stage this Vending Machine can change the items that your vending machine dispenses.

# Release Notes
## v2.0
- The Vending Machine now sources its button data from the button entity's `userData` rather than a JSON URL! This means you can more easily update the Marketplace Items served by the Vending Machine.
