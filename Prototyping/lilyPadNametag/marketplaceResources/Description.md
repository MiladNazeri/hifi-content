With User Inspector, you can click anywhere on an avatar and get a quick view of who they are with a few advantages:

1. Always see the same size nametag no matter how far away you are.
2. Define the size yourself through the custom app.
3. If you are an admin, you will see their username
4. If their display name changes, you will see the update.
5. If they are your friend, they will become a brighter color, and you can also see their username. 
6. The nametags won't ever get culled by avatars or the environment.
