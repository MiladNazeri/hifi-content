# EZ Status Update

# Description
Easy Status updater that lets you put a button on your desk to press and get a prompt to enter in your status that you would like to share with everyone.  It also includes a quick timestamp to let people know if it is recent. 

# Instructions
- Import this JSON:

- Go to create menu and find the button you just added by clicking on it (It will give you a prompt but just cancel).  

- Find the userdata section.  It will say username: "".  Fill yours in unless you don't care if anyone can update the status.

- Feel free to move the button and text around now.
