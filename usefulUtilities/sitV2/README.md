- During Create Mode when the entity has 0.5 alpha value or less, a local visible cube is added for easier adjustments. The visible cube disappears once Create mode is closed.

## Known issues

### Solution to other entities taking the "Click to Sit" click events

Collisions with other entity's invisible collision hulls sometimes make it difficult to sit. Ensure entities near sit cubes have the property `ignorePickIntersection: true`.

### Sit animation does not apply to an avatar using a different default animation

Animation that is applied before sitting is applied while in the chair and continues after standup. 

### Future features

Configurable variables:
- Custom animations specified via userData
- All configurable variables specified via userData

## Sit Configurations

### Configurable adjustments in Create Mode
- Adjust seat center - update the "Pivot" (to adjust the "registrationPoint" entity property) Ex: a stool for an avatar to sit in the middle on top, Pivot = { x: 0.5, y: 1.0, z: 0.5 }

### Configurable variables in userData
- Can click on chair to sit boolean in userData

Happy sitting V2!
