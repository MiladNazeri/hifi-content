# toggleFlyButton
The `toggleFlyButton.js` script can be attached to any entity. That entity will then become a button that, when clicked, will toggle the clicker's Flying preferences in VR mode ONLY. It won't do anything in Desktop mode.

A text local entity will appear near the entity that will display the user's current Flying preference in their current display mode.
