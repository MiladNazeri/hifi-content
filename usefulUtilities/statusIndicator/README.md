# Status Indicator
Let other avatars know your status!

This script creates a clickable button in upper right hand corner of your screen to set status to available or busy. The button only appears in Desktop mode.

A web app and database tracks these statuses. Using a web entity, you can display everyone's status in a table by going to:

To see everyone's status:
`https://<hostname>/getAllEmployees`

To see a team's list status:
`https://<hostname>/statusIndicator/team?teamName=<team name>`


## Setup

Run `<statusIndicator root>/hifiScript/statusIndicator.js` in High Fidelity's Running scripts.

## locationZoneClient.js Config

Update REQUEST_URL variable to `https://<hostname>/api/statusIndicator/`.

Add `locationZoneClient.js` as a client script to a zone entity. When a user enters the zone entity, the zone will update the user's location to the zone's name.

## Hifi App Script Config

The code for this content is open source. You must set up some configuration files for this content to work:
1. A `secrets.json` file in `<statusIndicator root>/hifiScript/secrets.json` that contains the data below.

```
{
    "REQUEST_URL": "https://<hostname>/api/statusIndicator/" 
}
```

* During development this REQUEST_URL was `http://localhost:3305/`

## HTML Readouts Config

In `allEmployees.html` and `teamPage.html`, you will need to replace `http://localhost:3305/` with `https://<hostname>/api/statusIndicator/` in the `fetch` function call.

`allEmployees.html` and `teamPage.html` will display "Loading Data..." if the fetch fails or the teamName is incorrect.

## Web App Config

The code for this content is open source. You must set up some configuration files for this content to work:
1. A `dbInfo.json` file in `<statusIndicator root>/webApp/dbInfo.json` that contains the data below.

### `dbInfo.json`
Here's what your `dbInfo.json` file should look like:
```
{
    "mySQLHost": "<the host associated with your database>",
    "mySQLUsername": "<MySQL DB username>",
    "mySQLPassword": "<MySQL DB password>",
    "databaseName": "<the name of the database associated with the Status Indicator app>"
}
```

## Testing
You can perform a local 1-person test of this new code by doing the following:
1. Perform configuration steps as per the "Config" section above.
2. Run the `statusIndicator_webApp.js` Web app from a local NodeJS v10.15.1 installation.
    - Run `npm install` from the `webApp/app` directory
    - Run `node statusIndicator_webApp.js` from the `webApp/app` directory
